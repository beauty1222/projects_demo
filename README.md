Driving after a lack of sleep is risky and drowsy drivers are more likely to be involved in car accidents. To address this issue, an Android application was created that can identify drowsy drivers. It includes a streak function that maintains track of how long the motorist has driven without being identified as being sleepy. This study offers a practical method for tracking drowsiness and monitoring driver weariness in real time. A mechanism for correctly detecting a driver's attention level dropping, as well as one for alerting and warning the driver, is necessary for preventing drowsy driving. To implement this detection strategy, an Android application was created that makes use of image processing technology and analyses every image taken with the user's phone camera. The degree to which the driver's eyes are open or closed determines if a drop in awareness has occurred.
